I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. ABC for evaluation for bariatric surgery. As you know 
she is a pleasant 54-year-old female who has multiple medical problems and is seeking evaluation for laparoscopic gastric banding. I saw her on October 3, 2008 in the office after she had attended a Fairfield County Bariatrics and Surgical Specialists seminar. she is 5'7 " and weighs 242 pounds. she has been overweight since age 27. she is now at her highest adult weight.
